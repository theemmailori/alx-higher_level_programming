ALX HIGHER LEVEL PROGRAMMING


Getting started with high-level programming in Python.


Synopsis
A high-level language is any programming language that enables development of a program in a much more user-friendly programming context and is generally independent of the computer's hardware architecture.

A high-level language has a higher level of abstraction from the computer, and focuses more on the programming logic rather than the underlying hardware components such as memory addressing and register utilization.

Description
At ALX Holberton School, we learn by doing. We have projects everyday that we have to push on GitHub in order for an automatic review to be done. This repository contains directories each corresponding to a high-level language project. These projects are part of the ALX Holberton School 1 year curriculum. In these projects, we cover everything from the basics of Python and Javascript (Node), as well as SQL (with MySQL) to more advanced topics.
